description: use KERNEL cloud browsers through the KERNEL mcp server. create stealth browser sessions, automate pages with playwright, the browser repl, or computer-use actions, reuse logged-in profiles and managed auth connections, and record replays. use whenever a task needs a real browser, a site that blocks bots, a logged-in session, or screenshots of a live page.

# KERNEL mcp

the KERNEL mcp server gives you hosted chromium sessions. nothing runs on the user's machine. every browser is a cloud vm that you create, drive, and delete through mcp tools.

on first use, grok opens a browser window so the user can sign in to KERNEL over oauth. during authorization the user can grant org-wide access or limit it to one KERNEL project.

## tools

### session lifecycle
- **manage_browsers**: `create`, `list`, `get`, `update`, `delete`, and `get_telemetry` for browser sessions. `create` returns a session id, cdp url, and live view url. options include `stealth`, `headless`, `proxy_id`, `profile_name`, `viewport_width`/`viewport_height`, and `timeout_seconds`.
- **manage_browser_pools**: pre-warmed pools for high-throughput work. create a pool, `acquire` a browser, and `release` it when done.

### driving a browser
- **execute_playwright_code**: run playwright typescript against an existing session. `page` is already in scope. return a value to get it back.
- **browser_repl**: persistent javascript repl inside the browser vm with playwright, patchright, and raw cdp. state survives across calls. start with `repl.help()`.
- **computer_action**: mouse, keyboard, scroll, and screenshot actions. batch several actions per call and end with a screenshot.
- **webmcp**: call structured tools a page exposes through webmcp. check for these before writing selectors for a site action.
- **browser_curl**: send http requests from inside the browser session, using its cookies and network path.
- **exec_command**: run shell commands inside the browser vm, for example to check dns, files, or logs.

### state and auth
- **manage_profiles**: saved cookies and local storage. `setup` opens a guided session so the user can log in once. pass `profile_name` to `manage_browsers` `create` to reuse it.
- **manage_auth_connections**: managed auth for third-party sites. before a task that needs an account, `list` connections for the domain. if none is authenticated, `login` starts a hosted sign-in flow the user completes in their own browser, so credentials and mfa stay out of chat.
- **manage_proxies**: datacenter, isp, residential, mobile, or custom proxies with country, state, or city targeting.
- **manage_extensions**: list and manage uploaded chrome extensions.

### other
- **manage_replays**: `start` and `stop` mp4 recordings of a session (paid plans).
- **manage_apps**: list apps, check deployment status, and invoke KERNEL apps.
- **search_docs**: search the KERNEL documentation.

## workflows

### browse or scrape a page
1. `manage_browsers` `create` with `stealth: true` if the site has bot detection.
2. `execute_playwright_code` to navigate and extract:
   ```typescript
   await page.goto("https://news.ycombinator.com");
   return await page.$$eval(".titleline > a", els =>
     els.slice(0, 10).map(e => e.textContent)
   );
   ```
3. `manage_browsers` `delete` when finished.

### work on a site that needs a login
1. `manage_auth_connections` `list` with the site's domain.
2. if a connection is `AUTHENTICATED`, create the browser with its `profile_name`. otherwise `create` a connection, run `login`, share the hosted url with the user, and `wait` until it completes.
3. run the task, then delete the browser.

### visual or coordinate-based tasks
1. `computer_action` with a `screenshot` to see the page.
2. batch `click_mouse`, `type_text`, and `press_key`, ending with another `screenshot`.

## tips
- delete browsers when you are done. set `timeout_seconds` as a backstop.
- use `headless: true` when nobody needs the live view. it starts faster.
- share the live view url when the user needs to watch or take over.
- if a session misbehaves, `manage_browsers` `get_telemetry` works on active and deleted sessions.
